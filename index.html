					<h2>A little about David</h2>
					<p>e: <a href="mailto:david.poxon@moinno.com" target="_blank">david.poxon@moinno.com</a></p>
					<p>David loves meeting new people so he can discuss and swap ideas old and new.</p>
					<p>Most of his time is spent researching static program analysis for information flow control. Previously he researched <a href="http://eprints.qut.edu.au/79712/" target="_blank">very large interfaces</a> and <a href="http://eprints.qut.edu.au/79704/" target="_blank">designing for people with intellectual disability</a>. He's known to natter on about program dependence graphs and data flow visualisation, and loves a good yarn about dynamic language program analysis (he's having a lot of fun with Python and JavaScript right now).</p>
					<p>When he's not playing research, David earns an honest day's dollar working with a pretty great bunch of people who like to build <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/it-pro/business-it/facial-recognition-success-rises-from-nicta-ashes-20140714-zt28e.html" target="_blank"> world-leading</a> facial recognition technology. If you ask him what he does for his day job, David will probably say something like, "if facial recognition technology were an internal combustion engine, you could say I build the chassis, and the steering wheel." David loves chatting about application architecture, how to curate a solid core codebase, and designing for user experience.</p>
					<p>On the weekend he likes to teach kids how to code at <a href="http://coderdojobrisbane.com.au/" target="_blank">CoderDojo Brisbane</a>.</p>

					<p>The design of this page is an homage to <a href="http://didact.us/beefy/" target="_blank">Beefy.js</a>.</p>
