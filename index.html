			<h2>A little about David</h2>
			<p>e: <a href="mailto:david.poxon@moinno.com" target="_blank">david.poxon@moinno.com</a></p>
			<p>David loves meeting new people so he can discuss and swap ideas old and new.</p>
			<p>Most of his time is spent researching static program analysis for information flow control. He would definitely talk about all things program dependence graph and program slicing with you, and probably most definitely dynamic language program analysis (he's having a lot of fun with Python and JavaScript right now). Previously he researched <a href="http://eprints.qut.edu.au/79712/" target="_blank">very large interfaces</a> and <a href="http://eprints.qut.edu.au/79704/" target="_blank">designing for people with intellectual disability</a>.</p>
			<p>When he's not playing research, David earns an honest day's dollar working with a pretty great bunch of people who like to build <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/it-pro/business-it/facial-recognition-success-rises-from-nicta-ashes-20140714-zt28e.html" target="_blank"> world-leading</a> facial recognition technology. He's in charge of making facial recognition avilable over the web via the browser, and an API. David loves chatting about application architecture and how to curate a solid core codebase.</p>
			<p>On the weekend he likes to teach kids how to code at <a href="http://coderdojobrisbane.com.au/" target="_blank">CoderDojo Brisbane</a>.</p>
